This repo is maintained by the UCSB Open Source Programs Team, as part of a
grant-funded initiative called the [UC OSPO Network](https://ucospo.net). We are a
small team of open source enthusiasts and participants, mostly from the UCSB
Library, who are working to build up more support services for open source at
UCSB.

This repo is intended to serve multiple purposes:

1. Showcase the impact of UCSB open source innovations.
2. Help aspiring contributors find open source projects at UCSB that they could
   potentially contribute to.
3. Increase the chances of collaboration between projects that might otherwise
   have never heard of each other.
4. Start discovering OS projects that may one day go into an envisioned UC
   software catalog (https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/orb-showcase). Don’t
   worry, we won’t add any of your data to the catalog without your permission.
