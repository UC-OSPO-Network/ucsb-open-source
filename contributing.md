Thanks for your interest in contributing to the ucsb-open-source list! Here are
some guidelines for contributing to this list.

# How to add your group/project to the list

Feel free to create pull request to add the info yourself, or you can create an
issue or email us at ospo@library.ucsb.edu and we'll add it for you. If you’d
like us to add a group, we just need two pieces of information:

- The group name
- A URL to a website or repo. You can provide multiple URLs if needed.

If you’d like us to add a project, we need the above info plus two more pieces
of information:

- A concise description of the project (preferably 100 characters or fewer)
- A discipline for the project. See the “disciplines.md” file in this repo. You
  may also select “Discipline-agnostic” as your discipline.

# Privacy Policy

## The UC OSPO Network will NOT do the following things without your permission:

- Copy your group/project information to another list or platform.

- Add you or your project to any mailing lists or other communication channels.

## The UC OSPO Network MIGHT do the following things:

- Contact you every few years or so to check that the listed project is still
  actively maintained.

- Occasionally (a couple of times a year, maybe) email you to promote special
  OSPO initiatives (e.g., our open source survey).

- Share this list on social media.

- Ask you if you might be interested in adding your project to a planned UC open
  source software catalog (work in progress
  [here](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/orb-showcase)). Don’t worry, we won’t
  add any of your data to the catalog without your permission.
